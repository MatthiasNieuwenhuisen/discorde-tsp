# Discorde TSP

Discorde TSP is an easy-to-use API for Concorde TSP solver in C and C++ programming languages. [Concorde](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde.html) is a solver for the symmetric traveling salesman problem (TSP) written in ANSI C programming language and is freely available for academic purposes. Concorde is a cutting-plane-based exact TSP solver (using [QSopt LP](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~bico/qsopt/) or [CPLEX](http://www.ibm.com/software/commerce/optimization/cplex-optimizer/)).

Concorde solver may be called directly from the command line interface or from C code using its libary that offers an API. However, Concorde API for C is not so well documented and it may be difficult to be used by new users. Therefore, Discorde TSP offers an simple interface for calling Concorde TSP solver from C and C++ programming languages.
